Returns the measured voltage. The resolution is approximately 10mV to 1mV

:cb:`Voltage` callback. You can set the callback configuration

export set_voltage_callback_configuration
"""
    $(SIGNATURES)

The period is the period with which the :cb:`Voltage` callback is triggered
periodically. A value of 0 turns the callback off.

If the `value has to change`-parameter is set to true, the callback is only
triggered after the value has changed. If the value didn't change
within the period, the callback is triggered immediately on change.

If it is set to false, the callback is continuously triggered with the period,
independent of the value.

It is furthermore possible to constrain the callback with thresholds.

The `option`-parameter together with min/max sets a threshold for the :cb:`Voltage` callback.

The following options are possible:

.. csv-table::
 :header: "Option", "Description"
 :widths: 10, 100

 "'x'",    "Threshold is turned off"
 "'o'",    "Threshold is triggered when the value is *outside* the min and max values"
 "'i'",    "Threshold is triggered when the value is *inside* or equal to the min and max values"
 "'<'",    "Threshold is triggered when the value is smaller than the min value (max is ignored)"
 "'>'",    "Threshold is triggered when the value is greater than the min value (max is ignored)"

If the option is set to 'x' (threshold turned off) the callback is triggered with the fixed period.

Sets the oversampling between 32x and 16384x. The Bricklet

a oversampling of 16384x is equivalent to an integration
time of 286ms.

The oversampling uses the moving average principle. A
new value is always calculated once per millisecond.

With increased oversampling the noise decreases. With decreased
oversampling the reaction time increases (changes in voltage will be
measured faster).
