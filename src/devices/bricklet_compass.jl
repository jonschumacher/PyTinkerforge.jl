The period is the period with which the :cb:`Heading` callback is triggered
periodically. A value of 0 turns the callback off.

If the `value has to change`-parameter is set to true, the callback is only
triggered after the value has changed. If the value didn't change
within the period, the callback is triggered immediately on change.

If it is set to false, the callback is continuously triggered with the period,
independent of the value.

It is furthermore possible to constrain the callback with thresholds.

The `option`-parameter together with min/max sets a threshold for the :cb:`Heading` callback.

The following options are possible:

 :header: "Option", "Description"
 :widths: 10, 100

 "'x'",    "Threshold is turned off"
 "'o'",    "Threshold is triggered when the value is *outside* the min and max values"
